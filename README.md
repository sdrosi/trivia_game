Modern Art Trivia Game
UCSD Coding Bootcamp
March 2018


- This project explores the uses and implementation of JQUERY, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and BootStrap, along with timing functions in a fun and rather challenging trivia theme of Modern Art.

- I created this project for an assignment in University of California San Diego's Coding and Web Development Bootcamp in Winter 2018.

- To get started, simply press the 'Let's Play' button. This button also serves as the reset button in case you'd like another go.
